Welcome to the Apache Hamilton Dataflow Hub!

We're excited to kick off this project and hope that it will be a useful resource for the community.
Apache Hamilton is like a Swiss army knife, it's very versatile, as you can use it for data, ML, LLM, and web work!

We envision this hub, as a place to share the flows you've built that can be useful to others! As well as a place
for you to find flows that others have built that you can use and easily modify for your work!

## How to use

1. Browse the dataflows defined.
2. Find a [dataflow](/docs) you want to use.
3. Cut and paste the code snippet to get started with it!
4. Use the dataflow as is, or modify it to your needs by copying it to your own repository via [copy()](https://hamilton.apache.org/en/latest/reference/dataflows/copy/).

## How to contribute

We're excited to have you contribute to the Apache Hamilton Dataflow Hub!
