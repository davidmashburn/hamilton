Installing hamilton is easy!

# Install

Apache Hamilton is a lightweight framework with a variety of extensions/plugins. To get started, you'll need the following:

- ``python >= 3.8``
- ``pip``

For help with python/pip/managing virtual environments see the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html/).

## Installing with pip

Apache Hamilton is published on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/sf-hamilton/) under ``sf-hamilton``. To install, run:

To use the DAG visualization functionality, instead install with

*Note: for visualization you may additionally need to install graphviz externally -- see*
[graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) *for instructions on the correct way for your
operating system.*
