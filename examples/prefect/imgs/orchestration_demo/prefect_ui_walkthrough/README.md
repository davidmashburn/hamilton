# Screenshot Organization

This folder stores screenshots for `/Users/davmash/code/hamilton/examples/prefect/prefect-ui-walkthrough.md`.

## Active folders

- `annotated/`: final screenshots with callouts used in the UI tour sections
- `raw/`: final unannotated screenshots used in artifact/Hamilton UI sections

Active filenames are semantic (no capture sequence numbers).

## Notes

- The walkthrough markdown references only files in `annotated/` and `raw/`.
- Historical/unused captures were removed to keep this folder easier to navigate.
